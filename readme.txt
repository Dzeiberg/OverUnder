Justification of Points

(possible points, module, what points we think we should get and (why))

1-2 sound and/or music: +2 (Because we have background music and sound effects along with the option to mute the music)

1-5 graphics: +5 (Because we created every graphic except for our in-game background, and we have animations for our players when they are moving in multiple directions and when they are crouching which required a lot of time)

1-3 physics: +3 (we have gravity that works properly on the players)

1-4 multiple levels/difficulties: +4 (we have a lot of levels and with each level, the difficulty increases with the addition of new elements and harder logic)

1-3 complex interactions between player and other objects: +3 (Our players have interactions with collecting keys to enter the gate. When the players collide with spikes and enemies they are reset to the beginning, and when a player presses a button, the button changes colors and also moves a wall)

1-2 complex properties of player (health, shields): +0

1-2 multiple players: +2 (we have two players who have different abilities)

1-2 universe bigger than screen: +2 (after each level, the gate brings you to a different room from your current screen)

1-5 other: +3 (Our game includes a complex interaction with our buttons and walls. This was very complex to code and it really requires the communication between the two players. Also, we coded a level generator which allowed us to create dynamic levels)

-2 impossible to win: 0 (our game can be completed with proper teamwork)

-2 too easy to win: 0 (it requires some logic skills to be able to complete each level)

-2 feedback not good: 0 (we have a message that pop up to encourage the players when they do something correct)

1-2 larger gameplay goals past single level goals: +2 (each level builds upon the other to eventually reach the final end screen)

1-5 originality of game: +5 (not many games have two players have different abilities and we have never played any where one player could jump very high and the other could crouch instead. Also, we feel that overall it is not really like any other games)

1-3 availability of cheat codes: +1 (we have a basic cheat code that moves you to the next level when you press enter)

-1-4 not fun to play: 0 (we actually enjoy playing this game)

1-2 goals are understood, well integrated, and appropriate: +2 (we explain the goals in our instructions screen and also include some messages in the game)

1-3 feedback informs player of what is important: +2 (we have messages that appear while in the game to inform the player of what they should be aware of)

1-5 user modifiable settings: +5 (we allow both players to pick their color in the options menu. Also while in game, the players have the ability to mute the music and sound effects. The players can also exit the game when they want to the main menu and resume to keep their progress)

1-5 menu functionality and thoughtfulness to user and their needs: +5 (For the menu screens we have buttons that navigate properly between the main menu, instructions, and options screen. Our buttons make sense and are very clear how to navigate from one screen to the other. The instructions provide adequate information for the player. The options screen gives the players modifiable settings and once in the game, the player can navigate back to the main menu and then back to the level they left off at. Also once they complete the game they can click a button to go back to the main menu again.)  

-2 faulty collision detection: 0 (our collisions work properly)

-2-4 bad or non-intuitive control of characters: 0 (we have instructions to tell the players how to move)

-2 no ability to stay in game after end of turn:  0 (once the players complete the game, they have the option to go back to the main menu to play again)

-2 only one life: 0 (the players do not have to exit the game if they die)

-2 other: 0 (we feel like our game functions as it should except for the differences between macs and PCs)
